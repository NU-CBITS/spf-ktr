  Some people prefer “a bit of color” to the skin. There is a safe alternative to tanning booths or lying out on the beach. Sunless, self-tanning creams and spray tans can darken the skin without increasing your risk of skin cancer.</p>
<p class="lead">
  You can find these creams at your local grocery store or pharmacy. A professional at a salon can also apply a spray tan. Be aware that even though you look like you have a tan, you need to practice sun protection just as much as you always do. The tan color is not protective against sun exposure.</p>

  <h4>
    IMPORTANT!</h4>
  <p>
    Do not use tanning booths because the artificial light is even more damaging than the sun.</p>
